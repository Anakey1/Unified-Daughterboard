# Unified Daughterboard Project

The Unified Daughterboard project provides a single compact daughterboard for converting USB-C to internal-facing JST-SR connection, for use with JST-SH type cables (pitch 1.00mm).  

The C1 daughterboard (USB Type C, variant 1) is designed to match the daughterboards found in products by Wilba.tech. Proper permissions have been obtained for this project.
