## Introduction
The Unified Daughterboard Project is an attempt by leading designers in the mechanical keyboard community to standardize the USB daughterboards used for their custom mechanical keyboard projects. It has initially been envisioned by users ai03, Wilba, Hineybush, Xelus, Xondat, aeryxz and Maximillian.

The main characteristic of this daughterboard is to integrate a USB Type C connector and the needed circuitry for USB2.0 operation in a small PCB that can be screwed to a keyboard chassis.

In its latest version, C3, this daughterboard also integrated ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) protection on the data lines of the USB connector through a specialized chip, overcurrent protection through a PTC fuse, overvoltage protection through a bidirectional TVS diode and shielding noise decoupling capabilities through a ferrite bead, and single-path grounding of the metallic chassis to which the daughterboard is attached.
